                     However, they are not. There is a subtle difference between HTML
                      elements and tags that many people aren't aware of. HTML Tags are 
                      building blocks of HTML Page. They tell the browser how it should 
                      display content to the user. A tag starts with a < bracket and ends
                       with a > bracket.</p></td>

                      Most tags must be opened <h1> and closed </h1> in order to function.
                     Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form
                     of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.</p></td>

                   Each of them is defined using different tags. Let’s have a look.
                   5.  Example of the HTML <ul> tag for creating an unordered list:
                    <!DOCTYPE html>

                      </body>
                    </html>
                    Example of the HTML <ol> tag for creating an ordered list:

                   6. What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML? With Example.
                </td>
                <td>6.   The class attribute in HTML is used to define a class of elements. It is used to group elements with similar properties. The class attribute can be added to any HTML element. For example, if you want to style all the headings in your document with a specific font and color, you can add the class attribute to all the headings and then define the style for that class in your CSS file.

                    Here’s an example of how to use the class attribute in HTML:
                    
                    <!DOCTYPE html>
                    <html>
                    <head>
                    <style>
                      .my-class {
                        color: red;
                        font-size: 20px;
                      }
                    </style>
                    </head>
                    <body>
                    
                    <h1 class="my-class">This is a heading</h1>
                    <p class="my-class">This is a paragraph.</p>
                    
                    </body>
                    </html></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>7.What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML
                    elements? With Example.
                        </td>
                        <td>7.   The main difference between the 'id' attribute and the 'class' attribute is that the 'id' attribute is used to identify a unique HTML element, while the 'class' attribute is used to specify a group of elements that share the same style or behavior¹². 

                            For example, if you have a paragraph element that you want to style differently from other paragraphs on your page, you can use an 'id' attribute to identify that specific paragraph. You can then use CSS to apply styles to that paragraph only. 
                            
                            html
                            <p id="unique-paragraph">This paragraph is unique.</p>
                            
                            
                            On the other hand, if you have several paragraphs on your page that you want to style in the same way, you can use a 'class' attribute to group those paragraphs together. You can then use CSS to apply styles to all of those paragraphs at once.
                            
                            html
                            <p class="common-paragraph">This paragraph is common.</p>

                Cell padding
                is used for formatting purpose which is used to specify the space needed between the edges of the cells and also in the cell contents. The general format of specifying cell padding is as follows:
                
                < table width="100" border="2" cellpadding="5">
                The above adds 5 pixels of padding inside each cell .<br>
              --> Cell Spacing:
                  Cell spacing is one also used f formatting but there is a major difference between cell padding and cell spacing. It is as follows: Cell padding is used to set extra space which is used to separate cell walls from their contents.
                  s But in contrast cell spacing is used to set space between cells.</td>
